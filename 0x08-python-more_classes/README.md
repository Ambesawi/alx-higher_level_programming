# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

## Resources

Read or watch:

- [Object Oriented Programming](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html) (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))
- [Object-Oriented Programming](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) (Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The `__init__` Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” `__str__`- and `__repr__`-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)
- [Class and Instance Attributes](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_class_and_instance_attributes.php)
- [classmethods and staticmethods](https://realpython.com/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/)
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php) (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”)
- [str vs repr](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/python-str-vs-repr)
